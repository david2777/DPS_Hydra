-Overhaul some functions (like getting a row) with the way I've done it on TASC before

-Multi-select for Task View
    -Will require a lot of reworking of functions that modify tasks
    
-Make a Job Status
    -Try to drive it via Task Statuses but without loading all tasks statuses on startup
    -Maybe have SQL server do this?

-Make some sort of job submitter

-Everything else
