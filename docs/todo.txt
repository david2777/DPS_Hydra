-[Done]Job kill doesn't actually kill the subprocess
    -[Tried changing, broke logs]Probably because we are using STDOUT
      -Should switch over to cominicate()
        -https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html
    -Also should add a check to see if it was killed or not
      -[Solution]If not, us os.kill()
    -Was caused by subprocess.kill() not working for some reason, using OS now

-[In Progress]Keep implementing new boards into farm View
    -[Mostly Done]Update button handlers
    -[Done]Figure out why table helpers don't like anything other than strings
    -[In Progress]Organize FarmView button handlers
    -[Done]Add NodeUtils for messing with nodes
    -[Done]Need to be able to see reqs in FarmView
    -[Done]Add button for viewing logs

-[Needs Work]Scheduler for onlineing and offlineing nodes

-[Done]Overhaul capabilities
    -Reqs and Capabilities MUST be in alphabetical order and reqs MUST have "%"
    instead of space and infront/behind to wildcard reqs that the node has but
    the task doesn't need

-[Done]Overhaul some functions (like getting a row) with the way I've done it on TASC before

-[Done]Overhaul Job Ticket setup
     -Job should hold a base command, start frame, end frame, and Maya File
     -Tasks should be run using these and get a dedicated frame number on creation

-[In Progress]Overhaul FarmView commands
     -Maybe too many buttons

-[In Progress]Add filters to JobTable in FarmView

-[Done]Multi-select for Task View
    -Will require a lot of reworking of functions that modify tasks

-[Doneish]Make a Job Status
    -Done on demand via Farmview when loading shot data for specific shots
    -Mostly should be done by RenderNodemain when it changes status in DB

-[Done]Make some sort of job submitter
    -Make a simple one for Maya?

-[Done]Need a way to limit nodes on test jobs
    -Limited jobs will pause all tasks above the node limit
    -Seems to be working for now, maybe missed some fringe error cases
    
-[High Priority]Make it prefer jobs with higher priority rather than ones submitted first

-Everything else
