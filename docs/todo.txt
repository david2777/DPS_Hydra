-Keep implementing new boards into farm View
    -Update button handlers 
    -Figure out why table helpers don't like anything other than strings

-[In Progress]Overhaul some functions (like getting a row) with the way I've done it on TASC before

-[Done]Overhaul Job Ticket setup
     -Job should hold a base command, start frame, end frame, and Maya File
     -Tasks should be run using these and get a dedicated frame number on creation

-[In Progress]Overhaul FarmView commands
     -Maybe too many buttons

-Add filters to JobTable in FarmView

-Multi-select for Task View
    -Will require a lot of reworking of functions that modify tasks
    
-Make a Job Status
    -Try to drive it via Task Statuses but without loading all tasks statuses on startup
    -Maybe have SQL server do this?
    -Maybe RenderNode + FarmView?

-Make some sort of job submitter

-Everything else
