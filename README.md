# DPS_Hydra
A RenderFarm software written in Python with a MySQL backend. For now primarily aimed at Maya on Windows. Very much a work in progress with lots to change to come.

Loosely based off of the [Project Hydra RenderFarm](https://github.com/CogswellProjectHydra/githubHydraRepo) from [Cogswell College](http://cogswell.edu/).
