-[In Progress]Work on Maya Submitter Script
    -Maybe need to add more submitter args to be able to add quotes to them

-[In Progress]Fix Bugs
    -Job Kill needs end time
    -Job Kill needs to be able to handle task not running on node
    -Assignment should check for response now that it starts render in separate thread

-[In Progress]Render consecutive frames
    -Need a new RenderLayer management system
    -New task/job system
        -Tasks will be generated at render time
        -TaskView will become QTreeWidget with RenderLayers as trunks
        -Each time a job is picked up it will send a RenderLayer and frame range
        and setup a task with the info to track progress.
        -Each subsequent time that RL is rendered it will make a NEW task
        -Probably have a system watching stdout on the render task or the log
        file to check for timeouts.
        -Timeouts will probably be timeout per frame * frames
    -Ideally, a way to track current render frame locally as a fallback
