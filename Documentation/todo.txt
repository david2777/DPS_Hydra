-[Done]Job kill doesn't actually kill the subprocess
    -[Tried changing, broke logs]Probably because we are using STDOUT
      -Should switch over to cominicate()
        -https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html
    -Also should add a check to see if it was killed or not
      -[Solution]If not, us os.kill()
    -Was caused by subprocess.kill() not working for some reason, using OS now

-[Done]Keep implementing new boards into farm View
    -[Mostly Done]Update button handlers
    -[Done]Figure out why table helpers don't like anything other than strings
    -[Done]Organize FarmView button handlers
    -[Done]Add NodeUtils for messing with nodes
    -[Done]Need to be able to see reqs in FarmView
    -[Done]Add button for viewing logs

-[Done]Overhaul capabilities
    -Reqs and Capabilities MUST be in alphabetical order and reqs MUST have "%"
    instead of space and infront/behind to wildcard reqs that the node has but
    the task doesn't need

-[Done]Overhaul some functions (like getting a row) with the way I've done it on TASC before

-[Done]Overhaul Job Ticket setup
     -Job should hold a base command, start frame, end frame, and Maya File
     -Tasks should be run using these and get a dedicated frame number on creation

-[Done]Multi-select for Task View
    -Will require a lot of reworking of functions that modify tasks

-[Done]Make a Job Status
    -Done on demand via Farmview when loading shot data for specific shots
    -Mostly should be done by RenderNodemain when it changes status in DB

-[Done]Make some sort of job submitter
    -Make a simple one for Maya?

-[Done]Need a way to limit nodes on test jobs
    -Limited jobs will pause all tasks above the node limit
    -Seems to be working for now, maybe missed some fringe error cases

-[Done]Make it prefer jobs with higher priority rather than ones submitted first
    -Changed sorting

-[Done]Make RenderNodeMain not pick up archived jobs

-[Done]Change UI to right click
    -[Done]Need to separate creation and activation of QMenus for toggles
        -Solved via class-wide variables instead

-[Done]Change Job/Task Ticketing System
    -Try not to store the same information over and over
    -RenderNodeMain will build command
    -This will make it so we can do stuff like multiple frames on a multi GPU
    node and multiple frames in a row in the future

    Taskboard:
    	Remove command
    	Remove createTime - Move to Job
    	Remove frame
    	Add startFrame
    	Add endFrame

    Jobboard:
    	Change taskDone to tasksComplete
    	Change totalTask to tasksTotal
